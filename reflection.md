For my portfolio website, I focused on creating a clean and responsive layout using custom CSS while keeping the design simple and user-friendly. The navigation bar was designed to be flexible, using flexbox display for desktop views and converting to a column layout on smaller screens through media queries. I also implemented a hover effect on navigation links to improve interactivity. One of the challenges I faced was ensuring the navigation bar adapted smoothly across different screen sizes. I resolved this by applying flex-wrap for better responsiveness and switching to a column-based navigation menu on smaller screens.
